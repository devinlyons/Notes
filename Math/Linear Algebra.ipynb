    "Vectors represent movement along axes in the order of x, y, z. Consider the vector:\n",

    "1 \\\\\n",
    "5 \\\\\n",
    "-2 \\\\\n",

    "\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector represents moving 1 to the right on the x-axis, 5 up on the y-axis and 2 back on the z-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each element in a vector is called an *element* or *coordinate*.\n",
    "A vector of _n_ real elements defines an _n_ dimensional vector and belongs to $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",
    "Such a vector can be said: $\\vec{x} \\in\\mathbb{R}^n$\n",

    "Vectors can be transposed from typical column-vectors into row-vectors. Transposition is given the symbol *T*.\n",

    "Two Matrices can also be multiplied together provided that they are compatible.\n",
    "Matrices $A$ and $B$ can by multiplied, $C = A \\times B$ if $A$ has dimensions $t \\times m$ and $B$ has dimensions $m \\times v$.\n",
    "This will produce a matrix of dimensions $t \\times v$.\n",
    "Note that the order the matrices appear in the equation matters.\n",
